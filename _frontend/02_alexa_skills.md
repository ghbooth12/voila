Amazon Alexa is a platform that we can interact with devices using voice. These devices are Amazon Echo, Dot and Tap. Alexa executes the voice-enabled software, called "Skills" and those skills can perform various tasks. I developed three skills and published.

Date Counter is one of the skills that I developed. Date Counter tells users how many weeks and days left until the date users say. For example:

User: "*Alexa, ask Date Counter how many weeks until December 25th*"<br>
Alexa: "*43 weeks and 6 days left until then.*"
