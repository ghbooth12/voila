The Pomodoro Technique aims to increase work productivity and quality. In its simplest form, it times work in 25-minute intervals, with five-minute breaks in between.

During a 25-minute session, users only focus on a task. During a break, users do not do anything related to work.

My Time manages these Pomodoro sessions. Users can record completed tasks and view a history of the tasks.
