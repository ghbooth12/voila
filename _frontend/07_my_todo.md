Todo Off is a self-destructing to-do list application built with AngularJS and Firebase. It manages to-do lists by automatically deleting tasks that have not been completed after seven days. Users can prioritize the todo items with three states - expired, completed, active.

If the task is not important enough to be completed within seven days, it does not belong on the to-do list. So it solves the problem of to-do list clutter.
